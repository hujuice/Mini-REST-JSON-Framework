Have some members data in a file model/members.csv.

Have a class to read data in model/Members.php.
The class takes some configuration at the __constructor.

Extend the class to have an __invoke method, if needed.
The __invoke method will take an array of params and switch to the appropriate functions.

Prepare one configuration ini file for both service and model, using sections.

Under your htdocs path, have a 'members.php' service.
In the members.php file build a new RestJson object giving it the configuration file.
Run.
