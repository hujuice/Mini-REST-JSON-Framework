PURPOSE
=======
Have a easy-to-use REST-JSON Framework for PHP

CONCEPTS
========
If you have a data repository, simply write a class to read its data.
Then, extend the class to have an __invoke method reading some $params.
    $params will come grom $_GET.
Also, extend the class to have a __construct method, reading some config.
See the example to learn more.

Prepare a ws.php (or the name you like) in your htdocs dir.
