PURPOSE
=======
Have a easy-to-use REST-JSON Framework for PHP

CONCEPTS
========
If you have a data repository, simply write a class to read its data.
Then, extend the class to have an __invoke method reading some $params.
    $params will come grom $_GET.
Also, extend the class to have a __construct method, reading some config.
See the example to learn more.

INSTALL
=======
Have the RestJson.php file somewhere.
Prepare a ws.php (or the name you like) in your htdocs dir.
Include the RestJson.php file.
Create a RestJson object, giving it a configuration path.
Run the ->run() method of the RestJson object.
